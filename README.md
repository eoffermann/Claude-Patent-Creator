**An AI-powered patent creation and analysis system for Claude Code.**

I built this because I needed to file a patent myself. I used AI to build the system, used the system to file the patent, and it worked. Now it's open source so anyone can use it. You do not need to be a lawyer or a programmer. If you can describe your idea in a chat window, you can use this.

In plain terms, this tool lets you:

- **Ask patent-rule questions in plain English.** "Do my claims have to be numbered?" "How long can the abstract be?" You get the actual rule, with a citation, in about a second. (Under the hood it searches the MPEP, the examiner's rulebook, plus the patent statutes and regulations.)
- **Find out whether your idea is actually new.** Search more than 100 million existing patents worldwide for anything close to your invention. This is called a *prior art* search, and it is the single most important step — it is how you learn whether a patent is even worth pursuing.
- **Get your draft checked before a human ever bills you an hour.** The tool reads your claims and application the way an examiner would and flags the mechanical problems: unclear wording, missing sections, an abstract that is too long. It also tells you which checks it *did not* run, so a clean report means what it says.
- **Make the drawings.** Patent-style diagrams and flowcharts from a description, no design software.
- **Go from "here is my idea" to a reviewable draft application.** A guided workflow takes your description (or even your source code), hunts for prior art, drafts claims and a specification, checks everything, and hands you a package a patent professional can review quickly — for US or European filing.

New to the vocabulary? Every term this page uses is explained in the [Glossary](#glossary) in plain English.

## What this tool will and will not do — read this first

This tool is built for people who cannot afford a mistake, so it is honest to a fault. Know what you are getting:

- **It will tell you "no."** If the search finds your idea already exists, the tool's job is to show you the evidence and save you the filing fee — not to flatter you into spending money. A well-reasoned "this is not new, and here is why" is the tool working, not failing.
- **It never says "verified" loosely.** Every automated check reports what it ran *and what it skipped*. If a report looks clean, you can trust that the words mean exactly what they say.
- **It does not file anything for you.** You review, you decide, you file. The tool prepares; you commit.
- **It is not a lawyer and does not give legal advice.** What it produces is a well-prepared draft plus organized evidence — built so that a patent professional's review is fast and cheap instead of slow and expensive. For anything you intend to file, have a registered patent practitioner look at it. The point of this tool is to make that look-over affordable, not to skip it.
- **Some judgments are human-only.** Whether your invention is "non-obvious" and whether it is the kind of thing patent law protects at all are legal judgments no software makes reliably. The tool arms you for those conversations; it does not have them for you.

## Quick Start

Never used Claude Code? It's Anthropic's AI assistant that runs in a terminal or as a desktop app — [install it first](https://claude.com/claude-code) (a paid Claude subscription is the only cost to start). Then come back here; setup is one command and the tool talks you through the rest.

Pick the path that fits your setup. All three get you to the same place.

### Option A: Claude Code Plugin (Easiest)

If you're already using Claude Code, this is the fastest way in:

```bash
# Add the marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator
/plugin install claude-patent-creator-standalone@claude-patent-creator

# Run setup
/claude-patent-creator-standalone:setup-patent-system
```

### Option B: One-Line Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator.git && patent-creator setup
```

This handles everything automatically: installs dependencies, detects your GPU, downloads MPEP PDFs (~500MB), builds the search index, and registers the MCP server with Claude Code. Restart Claude Code when it finishes.

### Option C: Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator.git
cd Claude-Patent-Creator

# Optional: use a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -e .
patent-creator setup
```

### Verify It Worked

After any install path, run:

```bash
patent-creator health
```

You should see a status report showing which components are ready. If something's off, the output will tell you what to fix.

## What Can I Actually Do With This?

Here are some real examples. You can type these directly in Claude Code and the right skill or tool kicks in automatically. Say it in your own words — the "what to say" column is a starting point, not a required incantation.

| What you want to do | What to say | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Find out if a rule applies to you | "Search MPEP for claim definiteness requirements" — or just "do my claims have to be written a certain way?" | The tool searches the examiner's rulebook and returns the relevant sections, with citations you can read yourself |
| See if your idea already exists | "Search for patents about [your idea]" — e.g. "self-heating coffee mug" | Searches 100M+ existing patents and shows you the closest matches, so you know what you're up against |
| Get your draft claims checked | "Review these claims" (paste them in) | Flags unclear wording, terms used before they're introduced, and structural problems — the mechanical mistakes an examiner rejects first |
| Check a whole application | `/full-review` | Runs the claims, description, and formatting checks together and reports everything at once |
| Go from idea to draft application | `/create-patent` | A guided workflow: describe the invention, the tool searches prior art, drafts, checks, and assembles a reviewable package (typically about an hour) |
| Make a drawing | "Create a block diagram showing [your system]" | Produces a patent-style figure, no design software needed |
| Dig deep on whether your idea is new | "Conduct a prior art search for [your invention]" | A thorough multi-angle hunt through existing patents, with an honest verdict on what it found |

---

## How It Works

*Everything from here down gets progressively more technical. You do not need any of it to use the tool — the sections above plus the [Glossary](#glossary) are enough. This part is for developers, patent professionals, and the curious.*

The system has two modes that can work independently or together:

**MCP Server** is the engine. It exposes 20+ tools that any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) can call programmatically. These tools handle search, analysis, and diagram generation.

**Claude Code Plugin** adds the interactive layer. Skills activate automatically based on what you're doing. Agents handle long-running tasks in the background. Slash commands give you quick access to common workflows.

Under the hood, patent regulation search uses a hybrid approach: FAISS vector search finds semantically similar content, BM25 lexical search catches exact terminology matches, and a cross-encoder reranker sorts the combined results by relevance. Patent search goes through Google BigQuery's public patent dataset.

```
You (Claude Code) ──> MCP Server ──> Search / Analysis / Diagrams
                           │
            ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
            v              v              v
     MPEP/USC/CFR     BigQuery        Graphviz
     (hybrid RAG)    (100M+ patents)   (diagrams)
```

## Installation Options

<details>
<summary><strong>What the setup wizard does (step by step)</strong></summary>

1. Installs Python package dependencies
2. Detects your hardware (NVIDIA GPU, Apple Silicon, or CPU-only)
3. If a GPU is detected, uninstalls CPU-only PyTorch and installs the GPU version
4. Restarts the setup process with GPU-enabled PyTorch
5. Downloads MPEP, 35 USC, and 37 CFR PDFs (~500MB) from the USPTO
6. Builds the hybrid search index (FAISS + BM25) with GPU acceleration if available
7. Registers the MCP server with Claude Code

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Using a virtual environment (recommended for isolation)</strong></summary>

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install git+https://github.com/RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator.git && patent-creator setup
```

If you go this route, remember to activate the venv before running any manual commands. Claude Code handles activation automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Loading as a local plugin (for development)</strong></summary>

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./Claude-Patent-Creator
```

This loads the plugin directly from your local checkout without installing from the marketplace.

</details>

### Getting the campaign workflow (skills)

The MCP server above gives Claude the TOOLS. The campaign workflow — the
skill that runs mining, prior art, worth-it economics, drafting, and the
red teams end to end — ships as a Claude Code plugin. Two commands:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add RobThePCGuy/Claude-Patent-Creator
claude plugin install claude-patent-creator-standalone@claude-patent-creator
```

Re-run the install command after upgrades to refresh the skills.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example`):

```bash
# Required for BigQuery patent search
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id

# Optional: EPO OPS API (for EP patent full-text search)
# Free registration at https://developers.epo.org
EPO_OPS_KEY=your-consumer-key
EPO_OPS_SECRET=your-consumer-secret

# Optional API keys (for HyDE query expansion)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional settings
PATENT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
PATENT_LOG_FORMAT=human
PATENT_ENABLE_METRICS=true
PATENT_MPEP_USE_HYDE=false
PATENT_MPEP_DEVICE=gpu
PATENT_OPERATION_TIMEOUT=300
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Setting up BigQuery (optional, for patent search)</strong></summary>

BigQuery gives you access to 100M+ worldwide patents. It requires a Google Cloud project with billing enabled (the public patent dataset itself is free to query within BigQuery's free tier).

```bash
# 1. Install Google Cloud SDK
# https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

# 2. Authenticate
gcloud auth application-default login

# 3. Set quota project (replace with your project ID)
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project your-project-id

# 4. Set the environment variable
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"   # Linux/macOS
$env:GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"     # Windows PowerShell

# 5. Test it
patent-creator check-bigquery
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows-specific setup notes</strong></summary>

**Git Bash is required** for the `claude mcp add` command on Windows. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and set the path:

```bash
# In your .env file
CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH=C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe
```

**Use forward slashes in MCP config paths.** The setup wizard handles this, but if you're configuring manually:

```bash
# Correct
claude mcp add ... -- "C:/Users/YourName/venv/Scripts/python.exe"

# Wrong (will fail)
claude mcp add ... -- "C:\Users\YourName\venv\Scripts\python.exe"
```

## Performance

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **MPEP Search** | 50-200ms | Hybrid FAISS + BM25 |
| **BigQuery Patent Search** | 1-3 sec | 100M+ patents |
| **USPTO API** | 500ms - 2s | Rate-limited by USPTO |
| **Index Build (GPU)** | 3-5 min | NVIDIA CUDA 12.8 |
| **Index Build (Apple Silicon)** | 8-12 min | MPS acceleration |
| **Index Build (CPU)** | 25-35 min | No GPU |

Resource usage: the loaded search index takes about 2-4GB of RAM and the index files are 500MB-1GB on disk. If you have a GPU, it'll use 1-2GB of VRAM for acceleration.

## Known Issues

> **This project is a work in progress.** Most features work, but expect some rough edges. Contributions, issues, and PRs are welcome.

Things to be aware of:

- **PyTorch install order matters.** Install PyTorch before `sentence-transformers`, or you'll end up with CPU-only PyTorch even on a GPU system. The setup wizard handles this, but it can bite you on manual installs.
- **BigQuery requires a Google Cloud project** with billing enabled. The patent data itself is free to query within the BigQuery free tier.
- **Some diagram types need Graphviz installed** as a system package (not just the Python bindings).
- **HyDE query expansion requires API keys** (Anthropic or OpenAI). It's optional and off by default.
- **Windows users need Git Bash** for the `claude mcp add` command. See [Windows setup notes](#configuration).

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full troubleshooting guide.

## Glossary

If you're coming from the development side and patent terminology is new (or vice versa), here's a quick reference:

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| **MPEP** | Manual of Patent Examining Procedure. The handbook patent examiners use at the USPTO. Think of it as the rulebook. |
| **35 USC** | Title 35 of the United States Code. The federal patent statutes. |
| **37 CFR** | Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The rules that implement the patent statutes. |
| **USPTO** | United States Patent and Trademark Office. The agency that grants patents. |
| **CPC** | Cooperative Patent Classification. A system for categorizing patents by technology area. |
| **Prior Art** | Anything publicly available before your filing date that's relevant to your invention. Finding it is how you figure out if your idea is actually new. |
| **112(a)** | The section of patent law requiring your application to fully describe and enable the invention. |
| **112(b)** | The section requiring your claims to be definite and clear. |
| **MPEP 608** | The section covering formalities like abstract length, title format, and drawing requirements. |
| **RAG** | Retrieval Augmented Generation. Instead of relying only on what the AI was trained on, it searches a database first and uses those results to give a better answer. |
| **FAISS** | Facebook AI Similarity Search. A fast way to find similar text by comparing mathematical representations of meaning. |
| **BM25** | A text search algorithm that matches exact words and phrases. Works alongside FAISS to catch things vector search might miss. |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol. A standard for connecting AI tools to AI models. It's how this system talks to Claude. |
| **IDS** | Information Disclosure Statement. A form listing prior art references you need to disclose to the USPTO. |
